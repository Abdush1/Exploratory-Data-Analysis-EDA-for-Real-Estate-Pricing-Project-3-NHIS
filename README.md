# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Real Estate Pricing
## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real estate dataset to gain insights into the factors that influence house sale prices. By analyzing property features, location, amenities, and other characteristics, this project aims to identify patterns and trends that can assist in data-driven pricing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset contains detailed information about houses, including:

Structural attributes (e.g., MSSubClass, BldgType, HouseStyle)

Size and area details (e.g., LotArea, GrLivArea, TotalSF)

Condition and quality indicators (e.g., OverallQual, OverallCond, ExterQual)

Amenities and features (e.g., Garage, Pool, Fireplace, Bsmt)

Sale information (e.g., SalePrice, SaleCondition)

## Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis

## Key Objectives

Understand the distribution of house prices

Explore relationships between property features and prices

Identify key features affecting pricing

Provide actionable insights for pricing strategy
## Insights

The analysis includes:

Correlation between features and SalePrice

Distribution plots for numerical features

Boxplots and bar charts for categorical features

Identification of luxury vs. standard homes

Insights on features like pool, garage, and basement
